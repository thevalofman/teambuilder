You just put 1-6 Pokémon names, and you'll get their cumulative defensive and offensive properties (for their types).

For Alolan forms of other Pokémon, the syntax is [name]-alola, and for mega evolutions, it's [name]-mega(-[x/y]).
## Plans for the future:
* A move effectivity tab.
* Abilities.
* Make the numbers have a colored background when their value isn't 0.
* Overall polish.

You can tinker with the .py file if you'd like. I use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to make my .exes, and I recommend you do the same. 

This program was made possible entirely thanks to the makers of [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and the [Pokepy wrapper](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokepy). Without them, I'd probably still be writing dictionaries of names and types for the original 151.
